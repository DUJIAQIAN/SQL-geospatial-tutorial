## Overview

NASA has numerous on-site computing centers to assist researchers with computational tasks. Until now most of these have provided high performance computing for modeling studies. The NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) is one such facility, providing resources for large climate simulation projects. 

Recently there has been a need to expand these resources to facilitate analysis of products generated by high performance computing tasks. Therefore the NCCS created the Advanced Data Analytics Platform ([ADAPT](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/adapt)), which is an on-site private cloud designed for large-scale data analytics. This system provides researchers with tools they need to visualize and process the large datasets from multiple platforms and models.

All HiMAT researchers have an opportunity to access these ADAPT resources. Team members must pass through a screening and security [process](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/adapt/user_access/how_do_i_get_access) and receive approval from the team lead and NASA administrators. 

## HiMAT ADAPT Architecture

ADAPT is a [managed Virtual Machine](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/adapt/capabilities) (VM) environment. Each user who is given access to ADAPT also gains access to a series of VMs, each running autonomously and dedicated to a specific project. For the HiMAT project we have provisioned approximately 15 Virtual Machines (VMs) for our work. These are labeled "himat101, himat102,..." etc. Each of these VMs is identical to the other. The reason we have multiple VMs is you can switch between them if one is being used by another team. There are monitoring resources available to assess the health of each VM through time.

All HiMAT users operate from their own dedicated home directory. This is a location where you can custom install software to meet your own particular needs. You can also store files here temporarily. 

HiMAT users also have access to a shared data repository (see below).

## Accessing ADAPT

Once you have passed through all the security procedures you should have a user ID, an RSA Token, a passcode and a password. You will need these to securely connect with ADAPT resources. 

Next, the way you access ADAPT varies a bit based on your local operating system. All users begin by initiating a secure shell [SSH connection](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/adapt/how_to_use_adapt/logging_into_adapt) to ADAPT. Linux and Mac users do this via any terminal connection, while we recommend that Windows users access via MobaXTerm. What you are doing in this step is creating a secure link between your local computer and a server on ADAPT that acts as a gatekeeper or "bastion" through which all other connections to the VM enviroment must pass. 

For new users, this step can be initially confusing. Once passing through these initial security requests it will seem that you are now "in" to ADAPT and ready to work. But really you are just through the first layer of security, sitting on the bastion server, from which you now must to make another secure connection to the VM environment where you will your work.

So the next step is to SSH yet again to the VM environment, in our case one of the himat101, etc. VMs. This is were our paths can diverge, because ADAPT offers both a Linux and Windows operating system environment. Note that users who want to use the Windows environment will need to email NCCS support asking for the extra credentials needed to login to that VM. 

Instructions for all of these steps are well explained [here](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/adapt/how_to_use_adapt/logging_into_adapt), but contact us if you need additional details related to HiMAT-specific topics.

## ADAPT Datasets

ADAPT provides HiMAT with direct access to the full Landsat, MODIS and MERRA [data sets](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/adapt/data). As team members generate new products, we will be hosting these in a file structure similar to that used for the existing NASA remote sensing and climate reanalysis datasets. Each user also has access to a 15 GB home directory and a 5 TB nobackup/scratch directory for large temporary files.

## Recommended Practices with HiMAT-ADAPT

HiMAT will use ADAPT primarily to store, process and visualize large gridded datasets.
