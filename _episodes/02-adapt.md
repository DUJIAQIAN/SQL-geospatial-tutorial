The NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) provides NASA-funded researchers with high performance computing resources. Within NCCS exists the Advanced Data Analytics Platform ([ADAPT](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/adapt)), which is an on-site private cloud designed for large-scale data analytics.

Within HiMAT we have provided researchers with the opportunity to access ADAPT resources. Team members must pass through a screening and security [process](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/adapt/user_access/how_do_i_get_access) and receive approval from the team lead and NASA administrators. 

Within the ADAPT infrastructure we have provisioned approximately 15 Virtual Machines (VMs). Once users have been approved for access they can connect to these resources [via SSH](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/adapt/how_to_use_adapt/logging_into_adapt) through either Linux or Windows operating systems.

ADAPT provides HiMAT with direct access to the full Landsat, MODIS and MERRA [data sets](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/adapt/data). As team members generate new products, we will be hosting these in a file structure similar to that used for the existing NASA remote sensing and climate reanalysis datasets. Each user also has access to a 15 GB home directory and a 5 TB nobackup/scratch directory for large temporary files.

HiMAT will use ADAPT primarily to store, process and visualize large gridded datasets.
