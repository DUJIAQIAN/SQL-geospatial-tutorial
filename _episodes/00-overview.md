## Introduction 

The purpose of this page is to describe the cloud computing infrastructure being designed and built for the NASA High Mountain Asia Team [HiMAT](http://himat.org). 

A core feature of the HiMAT project is the construction and utilization of data sharing tools to foster efficient collaboration, reproducible research and enhanced stakeholder engagement related to water resources. Our cloud-based data infrastructure aims to addresses several of the challenges that often limit effective collaboration in such large projects:

* cross-team collaboration necessitates the sharing of preliminary data products which are not yet fully validated and may not be ready to share with the public. Existing data infrastructures primarily store completed datasets on public-facing servers. So there is a considerable gap in our provisioning of privately accessible, cloud-based computational tools for this kind of research.
* datasets to be generated by HiMAT are particularly voluminous, for example high resolution satellite imagery. Many existing data centers are not set up to handle data of this size, and even if they are, it is unreasonable to be downloading datasets this large to local machines. Therefore we need methods to co-locate our processing/analysis with the location at which the data are stored.
* the development collaborative tools calls for some degree of customization in our computational infrastructure if we are to integrate our products and provide decision support to the region. Therefore investigators need to have full access to both front and backend computational components, without the need to submit requests to third party agencies. 

## Overall Design 

To address these challenges we are designing a multi-tiered approach to data handling, one that considers the type of data (raster, vector, time series) as well as its maturity/readiness for distribution. Therefore, where each reseracher goes to store, access and process their data depends on these initial considerations.
