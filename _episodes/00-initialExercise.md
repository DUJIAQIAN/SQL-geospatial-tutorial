## Research Questions

Whenever we set off to explore data, it is a good practice to make a list of the key research questions that will guide your analysis. In our examples, we will be guided by the following five questions:

> ## Questions
> ### 1. How many "TRESPASS" offenses occurred in total?
> ### 2. What is the most common crime in the dataset?
> ### 3. Which month has the most crimes?
> ### 4. Which census track has the highest crime rate?
> ### 5. What is the most common crime within 5 km of my house?
