## Software 

Throughout this tutorial we will be accessing a PostgreSQL database using a SQL client called [DBeaver](http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/). Follow this [link](http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/download/) to download and install the program on your computer.

## Files

* our lesson will use data from the [City of Seattle](https://data.seattle.gov/) to explore database functionality
* the City of Seattle has information on all reported crimes incidents since 2011 [Crime Incidents](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-incidents-after-2011/8pyp-fumz)
* we will use a data table which contains the crime incidents for the first six months of 2015 (each row corresponds to a crime incident)
